## What's Here

These are the **original planning documents** written BEFORE implementation of each phase began. They represent the initial waterfall-style plans.

| File | Phase | Status | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| phase-0-discovery.md | Phase 0 | Historical | Discovery and validation plan |
| phase-1-mvp.md | Phase 1 | Historical | Minimal viable search plan |
| phase-2-gleanings.md | Phase 2 | Historical | Gleanings integration plan |
| phase-3-enhanced.md | Phase 3 | **OUTDATED** | Says "Not Started" but Phase 3 is COMPLETE |
| phase-4-llm.md | Phase 4 | Active | Future planning for LLM integration |

## Why These Are Archived

**Reason**: These are **planning snapshots**, not implementation records.

As stated in CLAUDE.md:
> **"Plan like waterfall, implement in agile"**

What happened:
1. **Before implementation**: Created detailed waterfall plans (these files)
2. **During implementation**: Agile iteration revealed new requirements
3. **After implementation**: Actual work documented in chronicles/

**The problem**: Some files (especially phase-3-enhanced.md) became outdated as implementation evolved, creating confusion about what was actually built.

## Where to Find What

**For planning** (what we thought we'd build):
- These archived files

**For implementation** (what we actually built):
- chronicles/phase-X.md (detailed session notes)
- IMPLEMENTATION.md (progress tracker)

**For decisions** (why we built it that way):
- DECISIONS.md (decision registry)
- chronicles/ (decision context)

---

## Important Note

**phase-3-enhanced.md is particularly outdated**:
- Says: "Status: Not Started"
- Reality: Phase 3 COMPLETE (2025-12-01)
- Task list doesn't match actual work
- Actual Phase 3 work documented in chronicles/phase-3-implementation.md

**Archived**: 2025-12-14
**By**: Documentation cleanup (IMPLEMENTATION.md trim)
**Rationale**: Reduce confusion between planning (phases/) and implementation (chronicles/)
