# Current Context

## Current Focus

Knowledge archaeology session: Created KNOWLEDGE-ARCHAEOLOGY.md (meta-Temoa pattern) and TEMOA-ORIGINS.md (complete chronicle from Synthesis through scope evolution). Cleaned up vestigial files.

## Active Tasks

- [x] Remove vestigial files (.session, launchd.backup, *.backup)
- [x] Add backup patterns to .gitignore
- [x] Create KNOWLEDGE-ARCHAEOLOGY.md (Temoa solving same problem at multiple scales)
- [x] Create TEMOA-ORIGINS.md (complete arc from Synthesis to full vault search)
- [x] Document scope evolution: gleanings → full vault search with metadata filtering

## Blockers

None

## Context

- Knowledge archaeology documents preserve project evolution thinking
- KNOWLEDGE-ARCHAEOLOGY.md: Pattern of surfacing accumulated knowledge at 3 scales
- TEMOA-ORIGINS.md: Complete story from Synthesis foundation through scope pivots
- Key insight: "Gleanings were justification, vault search was actual product"
- Scope evolution: Nov 17 (entire vault) → Nov 22 (type filtering) → Dec (books/articles)
- Ready to try meta-Temoa: Index project docs with Temoa itself

## Next Session

Consider indexing Temoa docs as vault for searching development decisions/chronicles. Regular development: Phase 3.5.3 (metadata boosting) or Phase 4 (LLM).
