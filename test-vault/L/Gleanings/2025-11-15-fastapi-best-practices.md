# FastAPI Best Practices

Comprehensive guide to FastAPI patterns. Particularly useful sections on async/await and project structure.

Key takeaways:
- Use dependency injection for config
- Separate business logic from endpoints
- Background tasks for long-running operations
- Proper exception handling with custom exceptions

For Ixpantilia: Keep it simple initially, can refactor later if needed.
