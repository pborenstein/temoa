# Personal Knowledge Management

Systems and practices for capturing, organizing, and retrieving personal knowledge.

## The Problem

Information overload. We consume vast amounts but retain little. Tools for saving (bookmarks, notes) are easy. Tools for retrieval are hard.

## Common Approaches

### Zettelkasten
- Atomic notes (one idea per note)
- Linking over categorization
- Emergence over planning

### PARA Method
- Projects / Areas / Resources / Archive
- Action-oriented organization
- Good for task management

### Building a Second Brain
- CODE: Capture, Organize, Distill, Express
- Progressive summarization
- Just-in-time organization

## The Retrieval Problem

Most PKM focuses on **capture** and **organization**. But the real bottleneck is **retrieval**.

You can have thousands of perfectly organized notes and still never find what you need when you need it.

## Semantic Search as Solution

Traditional search: Keyword matching
Semantic search: Conceptual matching

Example:
- Query: "productivity systems"
- Keyword search finds: documents with literal phrase "productivity systems"
- Semantic search finds: GTD, Pomodoro, time blocking, etc.

This is why [[Ixpantilia]] focuses on semantic search - makes retrieval actually work.

## Tools

- [[Obsidian]] - Markdown-based, local-first
- Roam Research - Networked thought
- Logseq - Open source, graph-based
- Notion - All-in-one workspace (but cloud-based)

## Key Insight

The best PKM system is the one you actually use. Complexity kills adoption.
