# How to Take Smart Notes

By Sönke Ahrens. The definitive guide to Zettelkasten method for academic writing and knowledge work.

## Key Ideas

### The Slip-Box (Zettelkasten)

German sociologist Niklas Luhmann wrote 70 books and 400+ articles using a slip-box system. Secret: Every note is connected to the network.

### Why It Works

1. **Atomic notes**: One idea per note makes ideas reusable
2. **Linking**: Connections emerge organically, not forced into categories
3. **Writing as thinking**: Note-taking is not separate from writing/thinking

### The Process

1. **Fleeting notes**: Quick captures, inbox
2. **Literature notes**: What the source says (your words)
3. **Permanent notes**: What it means for your work

### Critical Insight

Don't organize by topic/category. Organize by **questions** and **arguments**.

Topics are too broad. Questions drive thinking.

## Limitations

- Requires discipline (daily processing)
- Slow payoff (compound returns)
- Can feel chaotic initially

## Application to [[Temoa]]

The zettelkasten approach validates the gleanings concept:
- Atomic notes (one link per gleaning)
- Linking over categorization (semantic search finds connections)
- Retrieval matters (making old notes resurface)

## Quotes

> "The slip-box is not a collection of notes. It is a thinking tool, a communication partner."

> "Writing is not what follows research, it is research."
