## 2025-11-02 

- Rabbi Gary's 80th (last?) birthday party at the shul. It is so loud in there. It's a bunch of noise that I can't cut through. W says my tolerance for being around people is diminished. I think what is diminished is my willingness to tolerate things I don't like.
- Like I don't like shaking hands anymore. I just don't. Never really did. Always overthought it. It's like hugging only even weirder because why?
- Then they started singing. Badly. And in harmony.
- Had my first [bug](https://github.com/pborenstein/obsidian-tag-tools/issues/5) on [Tagex](https://github.com/pborenstein/obsidian-tag-tools/) and had Claude write up a fix and new tests.
- The feeling is like being a product manager and fielding communication from the uh field. Small things, especially doc, I can handle, but the code I leave to Claude. This is pretty much what I would do in real life. Handle the things I know, and delegate the things that I don't know.
