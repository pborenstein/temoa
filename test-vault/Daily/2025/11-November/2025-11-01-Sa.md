## 2025-11-01 

- rabbit rabbit
- in slow horses the brown boy is more British than the skinhead
- how it smothers the rage and
- lets me be me
- S Mother's the rage
- there's a note
- there are things that are ostensibly easy to understand that I just don't get: Plato's allegory of the cave. Like that's it? What are you even trying to say
- tamps down the rage and the hurt -- it is the coping strategy
- the divide isn't with those people who disagree it's with people who occupy a different place and don't know it
- or it smothers the rage by not being able to focus on it
- not a smothering more as a lubricating away not allowing it to gum the works
- I've never gotten into Dr who.  listening to w watching it, I can see it has a lot to do with tone and cadence -- a lot of British style yelling. Can you take seriously a bbc-accented science fiction? also the aliens sound gravelly
