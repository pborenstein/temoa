## 2025-07-18 

- [[feeling of being smart]] like listening to a sermon by a clever rabbi linking two disparate verses via various techniques wordplay gematria atbashing
- I was on a good streak with The New York Times crossword puzzle I was answering I was you know certainly doing all the Monday Tuesday Wednesday puzzles a really good streak like 2830 days and I really wanted to keep the street going so I would like to take a peek and you look at Google the name of a show to find out who was the star or I would you know what just at the end I just started cheating using one of those cheating things but because the important thing was to keep streak alive at one point, I just I skipped a day and then I skipped another day and when I looked, I saw that I had 45 puzzles that I still haven’t done and this is what happens to me always with streak based kind of things like Duolingo is that at some point I get at first I’m really excited about my streak and I wanna keep my streak going and keep earning stickers and all that stuff and then you know one day I just don’t feel it and I just or I get busy I get distracted the point is that whatever it is gets interpreted as some moral failing like I failed to do my job I failed. Yes, I did fail to keep the street but at some point, the streak just becomes oppressive and you wanna say I just need to step back and step out
- If I don't think about it, I can just do it. Cannabis (like alcohol) silences "are you sure". I published [When I saw the head Astronomer](https://pborenstein.com/posts/head-astronomer/) in honor (there's another word that means acknowledge but takes a preposition and isn't "acknowledgement") of recent events. 
- [[the learned astronomer]] 
- A reddit post [A book that rubbed me the wrong way : r/Teachers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1m3fycg/a_book_that_rubbed_me_the_wrong_way/) Asked perplexity to [identify the book](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/3d64219a-413f-4c0e-888e-1f9ac9f60516)). It is [Rules for Camouflage eBook by Kirstin Cronn-Mills - EPUB | Rakuten Kobo United States](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/rules-for-camouflage?sId=c933f8bd-8367-433f-96ab-a769eedf6b55) so I bought it and will read it. I was interested in this part of the Perplexity report:
  > Author Kirstin Cronn-Mills deliberately crafted Mrs. Dearborn as a composite character representing real-world challenges faced by neurodivergent students. In explaining her creation, Cronn-Mills stated: “Because difficult and unkind teachers exist. Mrs. Dearborn is a combination of a real person who lives to make life hard for everyone around them, and a real person who stays willfully ignorant about neurodivergence”.
 - The thing is to get away from the idea that I have to produce something. Learning for the sake of learning, right?
