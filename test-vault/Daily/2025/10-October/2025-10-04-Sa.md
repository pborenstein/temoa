## 2025-10-04 

- What now. 
- grocery shopping with w
- [[APANTLI]]: local server running on my machine that routes requests to various LLMs. 
- i've been feeling so sad for so many tears (lol) you'd think I'd know what to do. I do know what to do: ride it out
- Experiments with
	- LiteLLM
	- Helicone -- this completely sucks

  Configuration Steps

  1. Start your Apantli server:
  apantli
  2. In Obsidian Copilot settings:
    - Go to Copilot Basic Settings
    - Navigate to API Keys section
    - Click Add Model
    - Select Custom Model
  3. Configure the custom model:
    - Provider: Select "3rd party (openai format)"
    - Base URL: http://localhost:4000/v1
    - Model Name: Use any model from your config.yaml (e.g., gpt-4.1-mini, claude-sonnet-4, claude-haiku-3.5)
    - API Key: Enter any value (e.g., not-used) - Apantli handles the actual API keys
  4. CORS option: If you encounter CORS errors, enable the CORS option in the custom model settings (note: this will disable streaming)

  Your proxy will now route all requests from Obsidian Copilot through Apantli, tracking costs and usage in the SQLite database while
  providing access to all configured models.
