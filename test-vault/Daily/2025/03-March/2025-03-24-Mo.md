## 2025-03-24 

- [13:16] 30mg. 1 beer
- yesterday my son made a pie: ![[blueberry pie.jpeg]]
- [13:30] 30mg -- meh
- [20:13] Working on the footnotes part of the [[PLYWOOD VIOLIN]]
- An excursus on _nasty little man_. It should have occurred to me then that that's when I should have drawn the line. It's not like she said it to me and then was mortified and apologized. That would be the least required to make the episode salvageable. But that didn't happen. What I got was a smirk. I imagine the dialog in her head: That was nasty, but pretty good, huh?"
- What I've realized since then is that people will show you who they are. It's like the AITAH posts "I love him he's perfect but there's this one thing he calls me a fucking whore etc etc".
- Obviously Clearly, it's much easier for me who has gone through it to not be afraid. I must have been terrified. So much terror, lol.
- I mean we knew, Carol and I had discussed with Con and Beth that there really was no way back from calling your partner (not that we used that word then) a cunt. I don't know why I didn't make the connection to/with the nasty little man episode.
- And yet I stayed. Hoping for change? Convincing myself that I was not being hurt. (Learned a lot about that later on.)
- Maybe, in some way, learning that I needed to hurt her. Leaving would, did hurt her. I imagine because I don't know what she really thought that I was cheating by leaving combat before she was satisfied. I think this is why she was so vicious when the judge rejected our agreement. It was another opportunity to hit me more.
- That's the thing about those people, isn't it? You feel bad that they're hurting you. Like they're not supposed to. Like this is an anomaly. And then you say: NO the anomaly was the nice person that used to be, the nice person that enticed me, only to put me into a dungeon of despair, and not the fun kind either.
- But neither is the anomaly. There is no anomaly. This is how this person behaves. Or, how this person is. It's easy, being calm and rational and not going through it at the moment, to the calm and rational. The thing is that people are unpredictable and sometimes they hurt other people.
- I imagine that she and I were waiting for the other to become the thing we thought they were at the beginning.
- Change is grand and noble, but not always.
- But, boy howdy, I tell you. Having a child will get you to that point really fast.
