## 2025-03-07 

- [12:17] No heaving
- I was looking at two repos to use as the framework for the [[PLYWOOD VIOLIN]] -- and it turns out I don't have a page for that. Let's go set one up.
- [18:37] Watching [[Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)]]
- [21:25] Watching [[The Year of Living Dangerously (1982)]]

So, on the [[PLYWOOD VIOLIN]] I've been looking at this guy's blog starters ^b6c36d
- [adamdjbrett/11ty-gets-tufte](https://github.com/adamdjbrett/11ty-gets-tufte/)
- [adamdjbrett/11ty-wisp](https://github.com/adamdjbrett/11ty-wisp)
But as I'm looking at them, I'm noticing that he's using stuff, but he doesn't talk about it. But looking at the commit history, it seems that the heavy work was done by [mesinkasir (Mesin Kasir)](https://github.com/mesinkasir) (Mesin Kasir seems to be Indonesian for Cash Register) who is sponsored by [adamdjbrett (Adam DJ Brett)](https://github.com/adamdjbrett) but it seems that mesinkasir actually does the work. They seem to have a few starters of their own that ADJB uses. (I don't think there's anything nefarious there. They seem to be working together, though my jaundiced eyes suspects an inequality between a Christian man and an Indonesian web designer.) ^d480ff

Let's look at what Mesin Kasir has done.
