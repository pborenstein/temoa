## 2025-08-20 

- made appointment for car finally
- cleaned up a bunch of stuff
- it's not like someday you notice you've accidentally written a novel
- funny thing is these ideas I have of who I am just aren't true
- and to extrapolate from what we learned at est 
- you're embarrassed to seem to be the way you are but you're the last person 
- The reason women can't be friends with straight men is that \#NotAllMenButWayMoreThanSome men will eventually make it weird
- It's been a long time since I've been friends with women, but I can't think of how any times I've seen it not happen
- Women who are off-limits are seldom attractive.
- It's kinda hard to talk about this without sounding like a pig
- But an example: When Annie stopped being attractive, she stopped being a friend. The truth there of course I'd that she wasn't a great person but I still sought to hangout with her because it's nice being around pretty people
- conversely pretty people become less attractive once you realize that they're unpleasant
- what would you pen if you couldn't use euphemisms
