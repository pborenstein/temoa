## 2025-04-02 

- Kind of an odd day, where it's almost 4 and I'm not sure what I've done besides eating lunch.
- I watched [[Below the Fray - The Charlie Rose Paradox]]
- I don't usually watch this sort of thing. For some reason I think that watching YouTubes is boring. On the other hand, it does seem to be the way people are making art.
- I don't know who this Beyond the Fray guy is. What I find fascinating is the production. I work on the same thing for months and make little progress. Guys like that seem to crank out good content as a side job. I know: comparison is the thief of joy. But still, [[scale|the world cannot support so many ballerinas]] 
- I find that I keep worrying about the Pulitzer before I've written anything. This is something that I can probably find in my Journals from college.
- So, what was my life about after all that?

- It's a little surprising to see that my work habits are the same no matter who I am working for. I thought I procrastinated (did a lot of other stuff) because I was avoiding doing the work which I assumed I didn't like.
- I figured that if I was doing work I liked 
	- ![[not a good employee]]
- I figured that if I was doing work I liked, I would just get to it. There would be no "but first I need to do this," and "before that," and etc. I thought I was doing all that preflightering in order to avoid work that I didn't like.
- But No. I was avoiding work.
- Didn't matter whether I liked it or not. It was always going to take me until 3pm to get started. If I was going to get started during daylight at all.
- I imagined that once I wasn't doing work I didn't like, I would become the kind of worker I was told I should have been. I imagined schedules. And plans. And my calendar would have 10-11:30 Obsidian Project / 11:30-12:30 Lunch / 12:30-2:30 Read all over it. And instead of it feeling oppressive, like it did when I worked for others, now it would feel liberating to have a plan for myself. It somehow didn't occur to me that all the planning and stuff and having to go to meetings and stuff was the stuff that I didn't like in the first place.
- I always (?) said: The domain doesn't matter. I want to work with interesting people doing interesting things.
- There was a time when I was drawing 24-hr clocks and shading in where I slept, where I worked. ANy time I did this exercise, I got anxious. There just wasn't enough time in the day to do anything. Nonetheless, I managed to waste it.
- [17:45] 
- I'm only using the OpenAI backend. I'm not really using GPTChat at all. So I go to the web site, and I think, golly, I think that I want to keep this. There is so much I ==could== do. Again.
- The no time/infinite time paradox. All my life it has been like this. 
- [21:26] playing with eleventy and buzzing a bit
- watching [[Sweet Smell of Success (1957)]]

- [Pricing - beehiiv — The newsletter platform built for growth](https://www.beehiiv.com/pricing) [17:20]
> Pricing that's simple, predictable, and built to scale.

- [Structuring Eleventy projects](https://www.webstoemp.com/blog/eleventy-projects-structure/) [21:22]
> One of the great things about Eleventy is its flexibility and its lack of assumptions about how your projects should be organized. However, in order to preserve my own sanity, I needed to come up with a default files and folders architecture that made sense to me.
