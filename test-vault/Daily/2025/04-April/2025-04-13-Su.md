## 2025-04-13 

- I like the look of boards covered with post it notes and cards to look at the shapes of my ideas, to rearrange them, with string linking one piece with another. 
- but I don't know how I would go about doing that. I don't really think of things as chunks -- the zettlekasten idea of "one idea per card" sounds good. makes sense. I haven't been able to effectuate [^1] such a thing. 
- although I would like to think of myself as someone who thinks visually, that's not really true
	- excursus: those aren't your real memories you're remembering such insignificant things, so silly I don't remember that. like only real trauma
	- look here's a way to avoid hurting others it requires you to learn some self control in the same way as having to remember to piss downwind
- I don't think of things visually but it does help me greatly to see a drawing or a graph. It's more about the shape of something being able to imagine how things fit together
- it helps me to imagine a unit circle to think about trig functions, but I don't have an intuitive sense of what sine or cosine look like. I know there are these elements and that there is a relationship between tyem
- sometimes most times it's about the shape of the relationship between things
- I've tried to reify how this works. this is when I try to draw diagrams or to make models (see [[documentation-flow.jpg]]) but these are only somewhat useful. 
- the "area under a curve" diagram helps me get the shape of calculus the same way the unit circle gives me the shape of trigonometry, but it doesn't help me actually do calculus
	- the subreddit is called r/No stupidQuestions but the answers are something else entirely
- I keep calling it shape, but I could also say weight or heft. it's a physical quality 
- The reason you can't be subversive when you're older is that there's less in the world that needs subversing
- I know what it's supposed to look like: I'll be leafing through a book, looking at a bunch of pictures, look up and see the thing that unlocks the puzzle, resolves the tension. And from the movies and the books is hard to tell whether performing the actions creates the event.
- Like asking if you can change the software a company produces by changing its organizational structure. [[Conway's Law]]
