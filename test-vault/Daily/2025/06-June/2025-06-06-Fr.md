## 2025-06-06 

- didn't gym
- mark -- no earth shattering revelations
- GLP-1 seems to make food not interesting
- Learning how Copilot works in VS code so I can vibe code stuff. Like the [[CAPON ISLANDS]] 
- Chatting with Lucretia
- Every once in a while when I'm looking at something that looks like it will be hard to learn, I have to remind myself that I don't _have_ to do anything. And there is not shame in being completely ignorant (sadly no longer unaware) of the [vinyl virtual file format](https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl)
- I don't need to know this. Ever.

Bases: How to filter from Front Matter. Updated for v1.9.2's new syntax.

Your quick reference for the new syntax released today. Full markdown example included.

([Original video and brief Dataview comparison](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1kty3q0/bases_vs_dataview_how_to_filter_from_front_matter/))

# individual Bases filters

Each property type requires slightly different syntax.  


Text property:`status`

    - or:
        - this.status.isEmpty()
        - status == this.status



List property: `author`

    - or:
        - this.author.isEmpty()
        - author.containsAny(this.author)



Date property: `publication-date`

    - or:
        - this.note["show-dates-after"].isEmpty()
        - note["publication-date"] >= this.note["show-publish-dates-after"]



# in the individual notes

These properties in your notes would work with the full example below.

    ---
    status: [text]
    tags: 
    author: [list]
    publication-date: [date]
    ---

# full markdown example

This is a complete "filter" note with YAML and a sample base.

In this example, we're filtering for status "to do" AND author "Your mom" AND tags "science" OR "astronomy".

    ---
    status: to do
    tags:
      - science
      - astronomy
    author:
      - Your mom
    show-dates-after: 2013-01-01
    ---
    
    ```base
    filters:
      and:
        - file.path != this.file.path
        - "!status.isEmpty()"
        - status != "complete"
        - status != "cancelled"
        - or:
            - this.status.isEmpty()
            - status == this.status
        - or:
            - this.tags.isEmpty()
            - tags.containsAny(this.tags)
        - or:
            - this.author.isEmpty()
            - author.containsAny(this.author)
        - or:
            - this.note["show-dates-after"].isEmpty()
            - note["publication-date"] >= this.note["show-dates-after"]
    properties:
      file.name:
        displayName: note
    views:
      - type: table
        name: all
        order:
          - file.name
          - publication-date
          - author
          - status
          - resource-status
          - media-type
          - tags
    
    ```



Multiple values for a single key act as logical "OR". Values across keys act as logical "AND".
