## 2025-05-04 

- Awake in a new place. Very quiet. 
- Food in Portland is so problematic somehow
- checked in walked around had a beer found a dispensary bought a couple of carts.
- I'm considering [[just (word)|just]] staying in the hotel room until I fall asleep or get hungry
- Every so often I have to remind myself that because I created the system, I am free to change it. Resisting the [[preserving-the-ur-notes|urge]] to preserve the origins of all the things. 

## learning about india

This article [['World's largest indigenous school' in Odisha is a jail. 'We're all monkeys,' says tribal student]] is about a school in a state in India. This is interesting to me because 
- it talks about indigenous students / what does indigenous mean in this case? 
- states in India / how many character reputation
- education in India
- technology vs social sciences
- great opportunity for poor
- great opportunity for corruption

This article [[Attacked in Odisha for being 'Bengali'; our religion wasn't asked, but provincial identity invoked fury Migrant workers]] also mentions Odisha
