## 2025-05-20 

- workout a little heavey today
- 🎙️ it’s like my brain keeps looking for something to engage in, but everything just seems like too much fucking trouble. I don’t wanna start a new series. I don’t wanna get to know new characters. I know some of the nonfiction I read is… I think what I’m saying is that I wanna be no I don’t wanna be entertained
- 🎙️ so I’m thinking of phrase tantmount living like the idea of tantamount reading something that gives you the feeling of reading but isn’t reading and so this is what I’m looking for out living something that gives me the feeling of living of being engaged without actually being engaged without actually having to deal with human beings and all their crap

I know these things
that the love of a father for a son is fierce unquenchable 
that the love of a father for a son is ephemeral
