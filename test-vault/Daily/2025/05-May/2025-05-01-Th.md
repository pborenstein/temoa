## 2025-05-01 

- Rabbit rabbit
- Upgrading to iphone 16 went smoothly. 
- The settings for the Obsidian Web Clipper plugin, though, didn't transfer over. 
- That means that I don't have the URL setting that adds a URL and its description to the end of this notes in Gleanings. 

### Things that were done

- Trying to straighten out the [[Financial Planning Fiasco]]. Sent [email](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/KtbxLzGXBKTJqZTXmxmDnBnhTWnqrfzGlB) to [[Susan Soares]] at LPL and [requested check](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/KtbxLvhKQxmlPrcHMTrhjTVhTfbHbsRfNq) from Vanguard
- Paid Dead River for 5/19
- [Ordered filter](https://cowaymega.com/35118645383/orders/c5d051533596b5c650284fbf3ff8ccc8) for the Air Purifier
- little bit of work on hanging indent for [[PBORENSTEIN 2025]]
