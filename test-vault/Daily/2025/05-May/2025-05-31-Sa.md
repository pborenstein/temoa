## 2025-05-31 

- Grocery shopping with Wendy
- dose of Mounjaro
- feeling slow like nothing is worth my time or maybe I'm not worth anything's time
- it's more like I'm not having any fun in my thoughts. I'm not getting what inspiration? There are bookstores and mountains in my dreams. Highways that go through the kind of mountainscape you see in late-twentieth-century science fiction book covers
- I've waited all my life to be this old to be entitled to be retrospective
- so, all this is fodder but and why don't why do I feel like I need permission to publish it (in the sense, yeah, of making it public) or feel the need to justify doing it
- it doesn't mean anything if it's not read see also [[kill the metrics in your head]]
- whatever gave you the idea that your stuff was worth being read
- and if it's not being read, why write it 
- ![[life story]]
- how about now? 
- What Lisa said after we fucked: "I guess now you'll have something to write about"
- how about now? What I know now is that I'd been doing things backwards, implementing [[if I did the thing in movies]]
- I'll betray my best friend, so I'll have something to write about, and it turned out that the event was pretty grim, alcohol was involved, there was nothing artistic in it.
- we were fooling ourselves into being adults
- I think I learned by the time I betrayed my second best friend that this would be a shitty way to live
- but now! forty years later the stories have acquired poignancy not for the rake I was but for the stupid sex-addled idiot who believed fucking trumped friendship. I thought maybe if I lived a poet's life, I'd be a poet.
- I knew a few. They would not have me as a friend (ie fuck) so and but I resented them. 
- where was I going with this? right. why I'm not working on the 2025 edition of pborenstein.com 
- so I've come to the point where the impulse to write and the impulse to fuck are connected. 
- [[The Clown Suit of Middle Age]]
- anyway
- the other axis is that I need something I'm supposed to be doing to not do so I can do the thing I want to do but I can't because I should be doing the thing I'm supposed to be doing so I am stuck in a cycle like trying to start a car
