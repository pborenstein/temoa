## 2025-02-07 
- [11:39] Met with Mark Kline. Talked about why how II feel that I must produce something. Where that comes from. Praise from teachers? A promise of talent.

  Now looking at the phrase "saving the world entire" (from [Sandedrin 37a](https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.37a.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en)) because that's how I feel when I'm saving little pieces of the web -- to use latter? -- l'havdil and all that.
- [13:23] Maybe it's more like this.

  Imagine an actor. Acting is a human being portraying another human being in such a way that an observer responds to the portrayal and not the actor. Of course this gets layered quickly. We respond to the particular way an actor portrays a role. Humphrey Bogart is always Bogart. Helburn (both A and K) is Hepburn. Christopher Walken. And so on.

  Now, an actor can do this portraying on their own, can't they? But when an actor does this, it doesn't count. Acting is impossible without an observer.

  So too, maybe, writing? Writing for myself is fine. Look, I'm doing it right now. But the thing of it is to elicit a response from an observer. Writing doesn't matter unless someone reads it. Otherwise you're just talking to yourself. Layers, again. The writer can be their own reader? Can an actor be the audience?
