# 2025-01-13 

- [00:26] This way of learning feels like the parts of my job I liked: learning new stuff and putting it together
- [[spreadsheets is all you need day 1]]
- Watching [[Gilda (1946)]]. Ballin Mundson the casino owner. One of the first scenes is the casino office the secret lair with a clever sound surveillance system and soundproofing louvers.
- But how have I never watched this movie before. The dialogue snaps 
- [09:50] one of the differences between the old web and now is that I was more trusting of a post about "a thing I made" Now I have to stop and wonder if it's a true nifty thing or click bait or phishing
- origins of things. I know change is gradual but I'm still fascinated by the idea that at time X it's water and time X + n it's ice.
- I love it when I use mathematical expressions as off I know what I'm talking about
- ~~TOREAD~~ [[My Writing Setup - Syncing from Obsidian]]. I think [this guy on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/s/XyROdviDjK) ~~may have figured out how to do what I've been thinking about~~. This didn't pan out. It uses some third-party AWS thing
- Sad that I won't have the fun of figuring it out. But as I told Gil, When you have a problem it's more than likely that someone has had the same problem before and fixed it. That's the kind of pithy aphorism that sticks with a kid
- [16:17] Talked to mom at 1300. The class at 1430. It's really good. I like the way my brain feels
- [20:32] A litle bit of messing around with tech. Installed new desktop version of reMarkable app. Recharged and updated the reMarkable itself.
- The term I use for this sort of stuff, like messing around with the blog software instead of writing blog posts, updating devices rather than using them, etc.
- I call that [[dicking around]] which is kind of unpleasant and less than euphonious. But I asked [[Claude]] to help me with that. Link in bio.
- Wow, did I wander. [22:46] 
- I was cleaning up my notes [[spreadsheets is all you need]] then I got sidetracked on putting together a précis of the class tracking down [[Ishan Anand]] and then over to the company he's at now. My guess is that he got some money when his firm Layer 0 got acquired by some firm that has a [website I can't](https://edg.io) figure out what they do which seems to have gone bust.
