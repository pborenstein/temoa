# 2025-01-15 

- [00:33] Still trying to get GIT LFS to work with the Obsidian Git Plugin as [described in the docs](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Integration+with+other+tools#Git+Large+File+Storage). I hardcoded the location of git-lfs because adding it to the path variable as [instructed](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Integration+with+other+tools#Git+Large+File+Storage) but I messed up because I put the path to the executable. So it probably would have worked without this change if I had done that right.

    ```sh
    #!/bin/sh
    command -v /opt/homebrew/bin/git-lfs >/dev/null 2>&1 || { printf >&2 "\n%s\n\n" "This repository is configured for Git LFS but 'git-lfs' was not found on your path. If you no longer wish to use Git LFS, remove this hook by deleting the 'pre-push' file in the hooks directory (set by 'core.hookspath'; usually '.git/hooks')."; exit 2; }
    /opt/homebrew/bin/git-lfs pre-push "$@"
    ```

- [00:40] OK, I think that works. All of this is because the Copilot plugin index was over 100MB.

    ```sh
    philip@ningal: ~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/amoxtli
    [main *>]$ git filter-repo --force  --path .copilot-index/copilot-index-01484678f19b6ff27c5240108bb1fa93.json --invert-paths
    NOTICE: Removing 'origin' remote; see 'Why is my origin removed?'
            in the manual if you want to push back there.

- Let's try now
- Still more to do

    ```sh
    git reflog expire --expire=now --all
    git gc --prune=now --aggressive
    ```
    
- OK now we have a clean repo
- Reindex the vault. Looks like it costs about $0.06
- Add to .gitignore
    
    ```sh
    [main *%=]$ git ignore --local .copilot-index/
    Adding pattern(s) to: .gitignore
    ... adding '.copilot-index/'
    
    Local gitignore: .gitignore
    .copilot-index/
    ```

- That was painful, but at least I didn't have to look at the lecture yet
- [01:54] That was some amazing Yak Shaving
- [03:07] Signed up for pixelfed. I think I used to have an account on mmm.page (because my username), but I can't log back into it. Whatevs.

Copilot is useful

- So here's a tjhing, As I've been refactoring my notes, I realize that for the most part, I don't need all that yaml matter. It was just an extra step that wasn't doing anything. I think I had this idea that everything was a potential web page
- [05:45] Saved webclipper settings to assets
- Does Web Clipper stash its data in safari?
- [07:01] no and I have class at
- [10:50] did I sleep? maybe? 
- [[Neil Gaiman]] I just posted on Bsky: Every generation gets the [[Woody Allen]] it deserves. I'm facinated by [[trust]] and [[betrayal]]
- I'm catching on to using links instead of tags. Already it worked. As I was making these notes, I realized that [[future me|past me]] had set up a link destination without a note for [[trust]]
- [13:39] got some sleep but I need more
- what I did last night was some grade a [[dicking around yak shaving|dicking around]]
- TOREAD [[Why Did Kendra Licari Cyberbully Her Own Daughter for Years]]
- Things I've learned so far about using Obsidian
  - Most pages will not be published
  - Front matter is not all that important
  - links are better than tags for finding and visualizing connections

- Dopamine
- Another thing I'm learning: this vault is *personal*. I've found myself hesitating about writing personal things, but that's part of the process maybe?
- Somehow I exceeded GitHub's no-charge LFS limit. How'd that happen. The file in question was 106 MB
- [21:36] Watching [[Don't Bother to Knock (1952)]]
