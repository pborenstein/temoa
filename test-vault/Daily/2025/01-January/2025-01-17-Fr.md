- something to read about working with Lightroom
- These couple youtube videos go into how to assess and replicate the look or style of other photographers. They might give you some good ideas

  > https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgwjSn7cGeg from Tone Fuentes, very succinct, 7:43 minutes

- The blurring of time. The later you go the easier it is to mistake how far apart contemporaries are. In 1990 no one would confuse REM with REO Speedwagon. Today [it's possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/rem/s/b8g7x2CBwg). There's a fragment from [[Walker Percy]]'s [[Love in the Ruins]] that I kind of remember "the age of traveling salesman"

- [08:02] David Lynch died yesterday. So much outpouring. I liked his films, and stuck with twin peaks for a while. Blue Velvet and all that. The actors who worked with him.

- I don't want to be motivated, I want to be understood. 

  Motivation seems to me a trick. The motivator tells you how well you're doing. To me it feels like an older woman pinching your cheek saying you're such a good boy. It's uncomfortable getting that kind of attention because it's meaningless. They do that for everyone.

- [[migration stories]] in the Americas
- TOREAD [[Things we learned about LLMs in 2024]]
