- [06:54] worked out
- [08:13] ~~TOWATCH~~ via https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/s/tmD2LpSZM4
    > An interesting interview (and book) about the history of notetaking
    > Listened to this interview with Roland Allen, author of "The Notebook: A history of thinking on paper". Very interesting for those who like to keep notes. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNGg7Bz31FI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNGg7Bz31FI) ^052034
- [08:53] At this Social Hour for documentarians see [[#^914206]]
- Video about beating the ATS system: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrR1Y1mnq3g
- [09:34] That was actually pretty fun, talking with people who care about the same kinds of things I do
- [11:57] Fucking paypal trying `deactivationqueries@paypal.com`
  > I think you limited my account by mistake. The case number is

  > PP-L-504019955442

  > I use this account only to pay for things

  > I do not  sell goods or services. I do not have a business account with PayPal.

   > I think the issue may have to do with these transactions where Evernote billed me and then refunded me. This is the only activity in recent weeks. The transactions are:

   > - 6LW87742BJ7937945 Auto purchase for Evernote
   > - 0TY80121EB9687359 Refund from Evernote
   > 
  > As you requested, I uploaded my government ID (NH drivers license), and a description of my business: I don't have a business.
  > 
   > Losing access to my PayPal account for payments is very inconvenient. I'd appreciate a review of this matter.

- inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/self/s/1NrF8Slt1h
> Don't be coy about your intentions. "In my heart I have already fucked you"

- [14:35] Session 2 of the LLM course. Already feeling behind.
    - BPE learning algorithm
    - projector.tensorflow.org
- The Scientific American monkeys on typewriters The title of the article in Scientific American that discussed monkeys on a typewriter using a computer program is “Monkeys, Typewriters and Networks”. It appeared in the July 1975 issue of the magazine.
 > This is the paper


- [[Romeo and Juliet were stupid]]
- something about the pick that I use to take the bud cups out of the Pax Plus. it’s interesting that I always put the pick away somewhere but when I go to use it, it’s not where I expect it to be. I know it has to be somewhere near my hands, but I don’t know why I didn’t put it back where I got it from. Orb why I didn't put it where I'd expect
- expectations, time now, time not now. maybe: here, not here; see also [[object permanence]]
- [21:47] listening to [blue eyes unchanged](https://music.apple.com/us/album/blue-eyes-unchanged/1156716926?i=1156717262) about an old woman whose eyes are unchanged from when she was a girl.
- [22:20] It's been a long day, but energizing. I'd say my mind is firing on all eight, but it's not. All day I've had these [[lacunae]] while talking to people. I can feel context evaporating. I know I wanted to say something but I couldn't quite get back to my point. Every digression is dangerous. But there -- here it had happened just now. I was checking to make sure I spelled lacunae right, and while doing that, completely lost my train of thought.
- So this is what I do: I keep going. But I know the word the thought was right there. But there's just an empty space there. [[aging]]
- [23:56] apparently my son got engaged a week ago and just forgot to tell me 😠
- Then when I told shifra & my mother, he got really upset. 
- Well, it's time for a new daily note [00:00]
