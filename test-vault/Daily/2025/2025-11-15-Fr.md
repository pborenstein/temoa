## Notes

Working on semantic search project. Need to understand how vector databases work for personal knowledge management.

Read about [[Obsidian]] plugins for search. Native search is fast but not semantic.

## Gleanings

- [Sentence Transformers - Pretrained Models](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html) - Overview of available embedding models, MiniLM vs MPNet trade-offs
- [Building a Local RAG System](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38309611) - HN discussion on local vs cloud RAG, privacy considerations
- [FastAPI Best Practices](https://github.com/zhanymkanov/fastapi-best-practices) - Async patterns, project structure, testing

## Tasks

- [x] Research embedding models
- [ ] Test Synthesis performance
- [ ] Design mobile UI mockup
